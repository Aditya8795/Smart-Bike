Overview
--------

This is the app which will work with the smart helmet being made to showcase in our college's technical
festival [Sangam at Pragyan][1]. 



Features
--------

we hope to implement the following features :

* The app should connect to the smart helmet's speaker via bluetooth and give directions to a specified location.

* It should alert the "emergency" numbers when/if the helmet reports an accident has occured. 

* It should alert the user with a incoming caller's contact name.

* It should be able to be used for keeping track of fuel and the app should alert the user in case of impending shortage
